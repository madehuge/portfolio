# React Project

This is a React project bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.  
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.  
See the section about [running tests](https://reactjs.org/docs/testing.html) for more information.

### `npm eject` 

**Note:** This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!  
If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
